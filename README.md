# Tasks to be done
- [ ] Flesh out this readme with details about the overall project and its architecture
- [ ] Add challenge description of what to extend with and what to fix (generally what we expect from you)
- [X] Create a docker setup to run the whole thing without having sqlite or java 11
- [ ] Add needed routes and logic in the skeleton for the challenge
- [ ] Add proper test coverage for the entire challenge

## Antaeus

Antaeus (/√¶nÀàtiÀê…ôs/), in Greek mythology, a giant of Libya, the son of the sea god Poseidon and the Earth goddess Gaia. He compelled all strangers who were passing through the country to wrestle with him. Whenever Antaeus touched the Earth (his mother), his strength was renewed, so that even if thrown to the ground, he was invincible. Heracles, in combat with him, discovered the source of his strength and, lifting him up from Earth, crushed him to death. Welcome to our challenge.

## The challenge

As most software as a service (SaaS) company, Pleo needs to charge a subscription fee every month. Our database contains a few invoices in the different markets we operate in. Your task is to build the logic that will pay those invoices on the first of the month. While this may seem simple, there is space for some decisions to be taken and you will be expected to justify them.

## Instructions
Fork this repo with your solution. We want to see your progression through commits (don‚Äôt commit the entire solution in 1 step) and don't forget to create a README.md to explain your though process.

Happy hacking üòÅ!
